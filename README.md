# gradeCalculator
Lab #6 - Creating a grade calculator to calculate my grade for this class. 

This java program is a grade calculator that calculates my total points of this class and returns the letter grade based on the final number. It has a dataExpect() method that takes the letter grade I seek (A,B or C) and returns one possibility of the scores I need on the remaining assignments and exams to get the grade. This repository contains the "grades.csv" file that has all the points I got from practice problems, lab and midterm exams, the source code - "gradeCalculator.java", and a output file - "report.txt" - that contains the print statement of my grade report and the demo of gradeExpect() method.
